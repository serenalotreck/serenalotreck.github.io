# Current projects
## Acclimation of photosynthesis to changing oxygen involves transcriptional and translational responses in wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana
To explore the impact of changing oxygen concentrations on photosynthesis and photorespiration, we grew plants at low (2%), ambient (21%) and high (40%) levels of oxygen, and characterized their photosynthetic responses. We see that plants restore their photosynthetic efficiency after 7 hours at 2% oxygen, while plants at 40% oxygen are unable to return to ambient levels of photosynthetic efficiency. This project focuses on using transcriptomic and proteomic analysis to explore the basis of this observation.

## Research facilitation
As a member of the Walker and Farre Labs, I serve in a research facilitation capacity across a variety of projects. Current examples include helping graduate students implement high-throughput screens with an HPC installation of AlphaFold3, debugging use of a tool for protein turnover analysis, and running statistical analyses for motif enrichment in potato.

# Past projects
## Applications of automated information extraction in the plant sciences
My dissertation research focused on the application of automated information extraction to plant science problems, seeking to simplify and streamline the process of information propagation among scientists to advance scientific progress.

### In a PICKLE: Building out training resources for natural language processing in the plant sciences

Many state-of-the-art algorithms for information extraction tasks require high-quality labeled data in the target domain, in which entities like genes and proteins, as well as the relationships between entities are labeled according to a set of annotation guidelines. While there exist guidelines and datasets for other domains, these resources need development in the plant sciences. In this project, we develop the Plant ScIenCe KnowLedgE Graph (PICKLE) corpus, and provide our annotation guidelines along with an initial corpus of 250 annotated abstracts. Additionally, we perform an analysis of the impact of adding new types to the evaluation of

### Bridging disciplinary gaps in desiccation tolerance research through bibliometric research
Using a citation network, we have demonstrated that while desiccation tolerance is a biological phenomenon that exists across kingdoms of life, reseaarchers studying those kingdoms very rarely cite literature from other study systems. Using bibliometric analysis, we examine some of the disciplinary biases in the study of desiccation tolerance, and propose a rule-based algorithm to recommend new attendees to specialized academic conference to improve the integration between biological study systems. <br><br>
