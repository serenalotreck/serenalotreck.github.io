### Graphing plants: Knowledge graphs as a hypothesis generation tool in the plant sciences
--------------
Information overload is a universal problem in the sciences, due to the [3% increase](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.23329?casa_token=wDGy6559dc0AAAAA%3A2yesVSc35EZ9Dw16QxvlnOdhn_7KsqN-plaa-MFzI_Rvx0C_3ErW7xEdxuv_PJEDf_Lft86qr_q_pPg) (across all scientific disciplines) in new publications per year from the mid-1980â€™s through 2010. High-quality research demands that hypotheses be based on the wealth of existing knowledge found in scientific literature, but researchers currently rely on predominantly [manual, labor-intensive methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/nj7612-457a) to manage this flow of information. This process consumes much of their time and results in a large quantity of missing information about previous work; most Background sections in academic papers only relate a [modest fraction of existing work](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11192-005-0014-8.pdf) on the subject at hand. **Knowledge graphs** (KG) are a representation of information automatically extracted from a large quantity of unstructured text like scientific papers, where real-world objects are represented as nodes and edges are the relations between them. KG embedding (KGE) tools can be leveraged to predict new links in these KG, thereby generating novel hypotheses about connections between biological entities that are based on a much larger swath of existing work than could ever be achieved manually. While this technique has been used extensively in the biomedical discipline, there has been limited uptake in the plant sciences due to the lack of clear, concise objectives for its application. The principal goal of this project is to develop a **specific yet adaptable framework for using KG as a tool to generate novel hypotheses that are well-grounded in previous work,** simultaneously increasing the quantity of previous knowledge integrated in the generation of new hypotheses and decreasing the need for intensive manual literature mining, giving researchers more time to perform more robust research.
