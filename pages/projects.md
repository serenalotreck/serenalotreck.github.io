## Applications of Automated Information Extraction in the Plant Sciences
My dissertation research focuses on the application of automated information extraction to plant science problems, seeking to simplify and streamline the process of information propagation among scientists to advance scientific progress. This work can be broken down into two current projects.

------------------
#### In a PICKLE: Building out training resources for natural language processing in the plant sciences

Many state-of-the-art algorithms for information extraction tasks require high-quality labeled data in the target domain, in which entities like genes and proteins, as well as the relationships between entities are labeled according to a set of annotation guidelines. While there exist guidelines and datasets for other domains, these resources need development in the plant sciences. In this project, we develop annotation guidelines for the Plant ScIenCe KnowLedgE Graph (PICKLE) corpus, along with 55 annotated abstracts.

*This work is currently under review for publication. Annotated documents and annotation guidelines will be made available upon publication.*

#### Improving biological relationship extraction from plant science literature

In the previous project, we demonstrate that existing state-of-the-art methods for information extraction from other domains are insufficient in the plant sciences. In this project, we explore alternative approaches to leverage the small amount of available training data in our target domain to improve the extraction of biological relationships from text.
